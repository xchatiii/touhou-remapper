# Touhou Remapper
A remapper for Touhou games made with [AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com).
Remaps everything to WASD JKL and LShift.
- WASD: Move
- J: Fire
- K: Spell / Bomb
- L: Special key (depends on game)
- Left shift: Focus

The original keys (arrow keys, Z, X, C) still work.

It supports all Touhou shmup control schemes (that uses arrow keys) including [POFV's multiplayer controls](https://en.touhouwiki.net/wiki/Phantasmagoria_of_Flower_View/Gameplay#Controls), unless it doesn't.
