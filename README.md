# Touhou Remapper
A remapper for Touhou games made with [AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com). Remaps everything to WASD JKL and LShift.

It supports all Touhou shmup control schemes (that uses arrow keys) including [POFV's multiplayer controls](https://en.touhouwiki.net/wiki/Phantasmagoria_of_Flower_View/Gameplay#Controls).
